# Neumorphic design

With this, I start a series of studies about Neumorphic design. I wanted to test my css skills and also get to know better about how it is styled. Every small project that is done here will have its own Readme file explaining where the concept came from, and giving credits do the owners.

> I do not indend to profit with none of these or, by any means, harm the design owner rights. If by any means, the owner feel uncomfortable with the code I've done. I will remove it from the repository right away. Also taking care with history and everything else.
